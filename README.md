# Swypo

Please teach me how to swipe, Android. :smile:

## Introduction

This repository holds an implementation of a [tutorial on Android tabs] (https://developer.android.com/training/implementing-navigation/lateral.html). Effective Navigation is the name of the original guide.

## Abilities

The app can do the following:
* Implement swipe across three sections.
* Start a new activity which contains a list of [Bible] (https://www.jw.org/en/publications/bible/nwt/books/) books that can be swiped horizontally.
* Start an external activity where one can choose a picture -- just to show how one can ensure that even after an app is switched, relaunching the app takes the user back to the app's home page.

## Limitations

The app is tutorial material. So there is:
* No much content really aside from what is mentioned in the Abilities section. :grin:
* The app does not follow [Material Design] (https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) [guidelines on tabs] (https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/tabs.html). :fearful:

## Possible Future Work

Some work in the future:
- [ ] Implement [Material Design tabs] (https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/tabs.html).
